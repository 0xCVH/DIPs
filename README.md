Your first PR should be a first draft of the final DIP. It must meet the formatting criteria enforced by the build (largely, correct metadata in the header). An editor will manually assign it a number before merging it. Make sure you include a discussions-to header with the URL to the [Devcon discussion forum](https://forum.devcon.org)

If your DIP requires images, the image files should be included in a subdirectory of the assets folder for that DIP as follows: assets/dip-N (where N is to be replaced with the DIP number). When linking to an image in the DIP, use relative links such as ../assets/dip-1/image.png.

 * **Accepted** - The Devcon Organisers have Accepted your DIP
