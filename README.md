## Devcon Improvement Proposals (DIPs)

Devcon Improvement Proposals (DIPs) provide a mechanism for collecting collaborative community input on what should be included at the upcoming Devcon. While we are excited to have a more formal process to hear ideas from the community (roughly inspired by the more decentralized PEP, BIP and EIP processes), this is an experiment, and it should be understood that approval of proposals ultimately lies solely with the Devcon team. DIPs focus on collaboration in the ecosystem, so please review [DIP-0](DIPs/DIP-0.md) and try to collaborate on other proposals before submitting your new DIP. *We're excited to see all of your great ideas!*
 
 
## Contributing

1. Review [DIP-0](DIPs/DIP-0.md)
2. Fork the repository by clicking "Fork" in the top right.
3. Add your DIP to your fork of the repository.
4. Submit a Pull Request to this repository

Your first PR should be a first draft of the final DIP. It must meet the formatting criteria enforced by the build (largely, correct metadata in the header). An editor will manually assign it a number before merging it. Make sure you include a discussions-to header with the URL to the [Devcon discussion forum](https://forum.devcon.org)

If your DIP requires images, the image files should be included in a subdirectory of the assets folder for that DIP as follows: assets/dip-N (where N is to be replaced with the DIP number). When linking to an image in the DIP, use relative links such as ../assets/dip-1/image.png.
